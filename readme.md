The CRUD
===============


Crud, crud, crud, aren't there tons of low quality softwares which do the same thing?

Well, I have to say that the "CRUD" word put this library in a hated category alongside with a lot of low quality libraries. 
However, this library is not even similar with his alternative. It provides a clean API created on top of the Illuminate components encapsulated enough to be framework-agnostic.
